Personal Database Project

As a person who loves video games but has too many and hasn’t beaten them all, I want to make a database that can help me visually see which game I haven’t beat.

I want to see how much time I’ve put into the game

I want to see how long on average the game takes to beat

I want to find out what the difference is between my current time and how long it is

I want to organize it to see which games I’m the closest to beating, to better choose what to prioritize


Backlog(game_Id, Achievement_Id, Order_to_play)
Game(Game_Id,Name, Hours_played, Total_hours,Completion%)
Achievement(Achievement_Id, Earned, Achievement_Total)
